***Create a class with a class attribute  a; create an object from it and set a directly using object a=b. Does this change the class attribute?***


--->>>



class Sample:
    a="Git" # This a is a class attribute 

obj = Sample()
obj.a="Lily"   #This a is an instance attribute which is formed only for obj

print(Sample.a)
print(obj.a)


# So, it does not change the class attribute.
#To change the class attribute we need to change obj to Sample, i.e. instead of writing obj.a, if we write Sample.a = "Lily", then the class attribute will also change to Lily.


Sample.a="Lily" #It will change the class attribute
print(Sample.a)
print(obj.a)



***OUTPUT***


Git
Lily
Lily
Lily
